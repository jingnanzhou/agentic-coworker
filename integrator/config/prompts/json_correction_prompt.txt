You are a strict JSON Schema expert.

Below is a JSON schema that failed validation against the official JSON Schema meta-schema, along with the validation error messages.

Your task:
1. Analyze the errors and explain briefly what was wrong.
2. Produce a corrected, fully valid JSON Schema that preserves the original intent and semantics.
3. Ensure the fixed schema passes Draft 2020-12 meta-schema validation.
4. Return only valid JSON (no extra commentary) in the final output block.

❌ Validation Errors:

🧩 Invalid JSON Schema:

Additional Instructions: Generate the Simplest Possible JSON Schema

Always favor simplicity.
Generate the most human-readable and minimal JSON Schema that still follows the generic schema rules.
Avoid advanced features unless they are strictly required by the API documentation.

Prefer these patterns:

Use "properties" with explicit keys — never patternProperties or propertyNames unless arbitrary keys are required.

Use "required" instead of minProperties / maxProperties.

Use "type": ["string","number","boolean"] instead of anyOf / oneOf when listing multiple simple types.

Use "additionalProperties": false for fixed objects, and
"additionalProperties": { "type": ["string","number","boolean"] } for open maps (e.g., query or headers).

Keep description concise and non-redundant.

Simplify the structure of inputSchema:
Each of the following — aint_path, aint_query, aint_headers, aint_body — should use direct property definitions:

"aint_path": {
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "userId": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "Use 'me' for the authenticated user."
    }
  },
  "required": ["userId"],
  "additionalProperties": false
}


Avoid unnecessary complexity:

❌ No patternProperties, propertyNames, dependencies, allOf, anyOf, or oneOf unless absolutely necessary.

❌ No minProperties, maxProperties, or overly restrictive format values unless specified by documentation.

Conflict rule:
When multiple valid modeling options exist, choose the simpler one.

Example reference structure:

{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "aint_path": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "id": { "type": "string" }
      },
      "required": ["id"],
      "additionalProperties": false
    },
    "aint_query": {
      "type": "object",
      "additionalProperties": { "type": ["string","number","boolean"] }
    }
  },
  "required": ["aint_path"],
  "additionalProperties": false
}


✅ Checklist Before Output

 Uses direct properties (no regex-based definitions)

 Uses required properly (no minProperties/maxProperties)

 No unnecessary combinators (anyOf, allOf, etc.)

 Correct additionalProperties usage

 Security tokens only in staticInput

 Body is omitted or simply defined when unused

Please output the corrected JSON schema in a single valid JSON block without meta data such as "$schema, $id, $comments etal except for description. I must ensure the output is valid JSON
